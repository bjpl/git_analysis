1. **Accents in Art and Design Handout** (DOCX/PDF)
   **Tags:** #design-principles #collaborative-learning #project-based #presentation-skills #visual-arts #interior-design #vocabulary-building #hands-on-activity
   This hands-on workshop material guides students through understanding "accent" as a design principle for creating emphasis in interior spaces. Students work in groups to design a room layout (living room, kitchen, bedroom, or bathroom), drawing floor plans and creating 3D furniture pieces from manila folders. They then strategically add colorful accents using markers and construction paper, learning to apply concepts like accent colors, accent walls, accent lighting, and accent furniture pieces. The activity culminates in presentations where students explain their design choices and demonstrate how accents create visual interest and focal points in their spaces.

2. **Accents in Language Handout** (DOCX)
   **Tags:** #pronunciation #linguistics #cultural-awareness #vocabulary-collocations #RP-vs-GA #connotation-exercises #accent-attitudes #sociolinguistics
   This language learning resource explores the concept of linguistic accents, focusing on pronunciation differences between RP (British) and GA (General American) English. The handout teaches students to recognize distinctive speech patterns through example words and sentences highlighting vowel sound variations (like "no," "hot," "can," "girl"). It includes a comprehensive list of adjective-accent collocations (beautiful accent, heavy accent, slight accent) and features a connotation exercise where students categorize these descriptors as positive, neutral, or negative. This material helps students understand how accents function as distinctive markers of regional and cultural identity while building vocabulary for discussing pronunciation and speech patterns in a respectful, nuanced way.

3. **Clause Structure Analysis** (PDF)
   **Tags:** #grammar-analysis #sentence-structure #academic-writing #authentic-materials #conference-language #chart-completion #form-focused #systematic-practice
   This comprehensive grammar worksheet teaches students to identify and analyze the components of English clauses through practical examples from academic conference submissions. Students practice circling verbs, underlining subjects, and double-underlining complements before mapping these elements onto a structured chart with columns for adverbs/prepositional phrases, subjects, finite verbs, other verbs, and complements. The material uses authentic sentences from AIA conference submissions, making it particularly relevant for academic and professional writing. The worksheet includes both analysis exercises where students break down existing sentences and production tasks where they create their own clauses following the same structural patterns.

4. **Futuristic Devices** (PDF)
   **Tags:** #vocabulary-building #speaking-skills #presentation #technology #market-segments #creative-thinking #pitch-practice #business-communication #TBLT-strong
   This creative vocabulary and speaking activity combines technology terminology with market segmentation concepts for an engaging rapid-fire pitch exercise. Students select combinations from three categories: device types (mobile, medical, gaming, communication devices), device functions (devices that measure, connect, detect, or convert), and target market segments (convenience-driven consumers, environmentally aware consumers, variety seekers). They then prepare and deliver short product pitches to classmates, explaining what their futuristic device is, what it does, and why it appeals to their chosen market segment. This exercise builds vocabulary, improves collocation knowledge, and develops presentation skills while encouraging creative thinking about technology and consumer needs.

5. **Noun Phrase Structure** (PDF)
   **Tags:** #advanced-grammar #noun-phrases #academic-register #authentic-texts #systematic-analysis #production-practice #discourse-analysis #form-focused
   This advanced grammar resource helps students master the complex structure of English noun phrases through systematic analysis of academic sentences. The material presents authentic examples from design and academic texts where students identify head nouns within longer noun phrases, then break down the complete phrases into their components: quantifiers, determiners, adverbs, adjectives, noun modifiers, prepositional phrases, and embedded clauses. The worksheet progresses from analysis to production, with students creating their own complex noun phrases to complete sentences about learning English, career goals, and their field of study. This systematic approach helps students understand and produce the sophisticated noun phrases essential for academic writing.

6. **Selected Reporting Verbs and What Follows - Simplified** (PDF)
   **Tags:** #academic-writing #reporting-verbs #COCA-corpus #reference-material #citation-skills #grammar-patterns #research-writing #paraphrasing
   This reference guide provides a comprehensive list of academic reporting verbs organized by function (addition, agreement, argument, conclusion, discussion, emphasis, evaluation, explanation, presentation, and suggestion) with their grammatical patterns based on the COCA-Academic corpus. Each verb entry shows what structures can follow it—noun phrases, noun clauses with "that," or specific question words (how, what, whether). The material helps students choose appropriate reporting verbs for academic writing and use them with correct grammar, essential for paraphrasing, summarizing, and citing sources. The simplified format makes it an excellent quick reference for essay writing and research papers.

7. **To Non-finite Clause Practice** (PDF)
   **Tags:** #infinitive-constructions #academic-register #evaluative-adjectives #corpus-based #collocations #controlled-practice #formal-writing #pattern-practice
   This ESL grammar worksheet focuses on infinitive constructions commonly used in academic and professional contexts, particularly with evaluative adjectives. Students practice forming sentences using patterns like "It is important/necessary/difficult to..." combined with appropriate verb collocations drawn from corpus data. The material includes extensive collocation lists showing which verbs naturally follow each adjective (e.g., "It is important to note, remember, understand"), with bold text indicating the strongest collocations. The worksheet progresses from controlled practice with provided examples about design and art to free production where students create sentences relevant to their own field, making it particularly useful for developing the formal register needed in academic writing.

8. **680 Final Winter 2018** (DOCX)
   **Tags:** #assessment #academic-writing #summary-response #critical-thinking #synthesis #web-art #technology-in-arts #exam #advanced-proficiency
   This ESL 680 final exam assesses advanced academic English proficiency through multiple writing tasks. The exam includes four short-answer questions (4-7 sentences each) covering strategies for succeeding in ESL 680, reasons for choosing SCAD for graduate school, limitations of technology in art/design fields, and predictions about future qualities needed by artists/designers. The main component is a summary and response task based on an article by Annette Weintraub about web art from 1997, requiring students to summarize the article's main ideas and respond with examples showing how artists have addressed challenges of cyberspace, media, and audience feedback since then. The exam tests critical reading, academic writing, paraphrasing, and the ability to synthesize ideas from multiple sources.

9. **680 Midterm Winter 2018** (DOCX)
   **Tags:** #assessment #academic-writing #summary-response #evidence-based-writing #future-of-arts #professional-artists #exam #intermediate-proficiency
   This ESL 680 midterm examination evaluates intermediate academic English skills through structured writing tasks. It contains four short-answer questions (4-7 sentences each) asking about influential language teachers, recent studio course learning, the future of students' fields, and imaginary useful technologies, requiring evidence from course readings (Enhuber 2015, Reeves et al. 2016, Klimmt et al. 2012). The primary assessment is a detailed summary and response based on a 1981 article by Yona Friedman about a future without professional artists, where students must paraphrase main ideas and argue whether this possibility remains valid in 2018, supporting their position with evidence from multiple academic sources.

10. **E-Textbook for Research and Writing in TLM** (PDF)
