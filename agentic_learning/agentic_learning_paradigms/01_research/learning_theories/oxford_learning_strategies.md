## 💡 Integration with Agentic Learning

### Enhanced Strategy Implementation

#### Memory Strategies + AI
```python
class EnhancedMemoryStrategy:
    def __init__(self, flow_nexus_client):
        self.ai_memory = flow_nexus_client
        self.strategies = {
            'grouping': self.ai_assisted_grouping,
            'association': self.quantum_association,
            'imagery': self.holographic_visualization,
            'mapping': self.fractal_semantic_mapping
        }
    
    def ai_assisted_grouping(self, content):
        # AI analyzes optimal grouping patterns
        return self.ai_memory.analyze_patterns(content)
    
    def quantum_association(self, concepts):
        # Create superposition of associations
        return self.ai_memory.create_quantum_links(concepts)
```

#### Cognitive Strategies + Swarm Intelligence
```python
class SwarmCognitiveProcessor:
    def __init__(self, swarm_manager):
        self.swarm = swarm_manager
        
    async def distributed_analysis(self, problem):
        agents = await self.swarm.spawn_analysts(5)
        perspectives = await asyncio.gather(*[
            agent.analyze(problem) for agent in agents
        ])
        return self.synthesize_perspectives(perspectives)
```

### Strategic Enhancements by Paradigm
