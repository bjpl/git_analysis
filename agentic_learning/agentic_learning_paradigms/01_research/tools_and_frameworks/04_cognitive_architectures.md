    def model_consciousness_level(self, user_state):
        # Create atoms for user state
        atoms = self.create_atoms(user_state)
        
        # Attention allocation (Global Workspace Theory)
        focused = self.attention.get_focus(atoms)
        
        # Reasoning about consciousness
        level = self.pln.infer(

        self.agent = self.soar_kernel.CreateAgent("learner")
        
    def set_learning_goal(self, goal):
        # Create problem space
        self.agent.ExecuteCommandLine(
            f"sp {{propose*learning-goal"
            f"   (state <s> ^type learning)"

        )
    
    def learn_from_impasse(self):
        # When stuck, learn new rule
        self.agent.ExecuteCommandLine("learn --on")
        # Chunking creates new rules from problem-solving
```

            return self.procedural.fire_production(stimulus)
        
        # System 2: Slow, deliberate
        else:
            # Retrieve relevant facts
            facts = self.declarative.retrieve(stimulus)
            
            # Deliberate reasoning

### 4. CLARION - Connectionist/Symbolic Hybrid

**Overview**: Integrates neural networks with symbolic reasoning, explicit/implicit distinction

**Architecture Layers**:
```python
class CLARIONArchitecture:
    """
    Dual-process cognitive architecture
    """
    def __init__(self):
        # Two levels per subsystem
        self.action = {
            "explicit": "Rule-based action",
            "implicit": "Neural network action"
        }
        
        self.non_action = {
            "explicit": "Declarative knowledge",
            "implicit": "Associative memory"
        }
        
        self.motivation = {
            "explicit": "Goals and plans",
            "implicit": "Drives and needs"
        }

            "explicit": "Conscious monitoring",
            "implicit": "Unconscious regulation"
        }
```

**Learning Mechanisms**:

```python
class ExplicitImplicitLearning:
    """
    CLARION for dual learning processes
    """
    def learn_concept(self, examples):
        # Implicit learning (neural network)
        self.implicit_network.train(examples)
        
        # Extract rules (bottom-up)
        rules = self.extract_rules(self.implicit_network)
        
        # Explicit reasoning with rules
        self.explicit_rules.add(rules)
        
        # Top-down: rules guide implicit
        self.implicit_network.bias_with_rules(rules)
        
        return self.dual_process_understanding()
```

## üéØ Recommendations for Prometheus v3

### Hybrid Implementation Strategy

```python
class PrometheusNOTE: "This is a demonstration of potential use of multiple architectures, not actual implementation code"Architecture:
    """
    Combine best aspects of multiple architectures
    """
    def __init__(self):
        # OpenCog for consciousness and AGI
        self.consciousness = OpenCogConsciousness()
        
        # ACT-R for memory and dual-process
        self.memory_system = ACTRMemory()
        
        # CLARION for implicit/explicit learning
        self.learning_system = CLARIONLearning()
        
        # Soar for goal management
        self.goal_system = SoarGoals()
    
    def process_learning_event(self, event):
        # Goal management (Soar)
        goal = self.goal_system.current_goal()
        
        # Dual-process decision (ACT-R)
        if self.memory_system.can_use_system1(event):
            response = self.memory_system.fast_response(event)
        else:
            response = self.memory_system.deliberate(event)
        
        # Learning (CLARION)
        self.learning_system.learn_from_experience(event, response)
        
        # Consciousness update (OpenCog)
        self.consciousness.update_awareness(event, response, goal)
        
        return response
```

### Practical Implementation Plan

**Week 1 - Memory Systems**:
```python
# Start with ACT-R memory equations
class MemoryActivation:
    def calculate_activation(self, chunk, context):
        base_level = self.calculate_base_level(chunk.uses)
        spreading = self.calculate_spreading(context)
        noise = random.gauss(0, 0.1)
        return base_level + spreading + noise
```

**Week 2 - Dual Process**:
```python
# Implement CLARION-style dual process
class DualProcess:
    def __init__(self):
        self.implicit = NeuralNetwork()
        self.explicit = RuleSystem()
```

**Week 3 - Consciousness**:
```python
# OpenCog-inspired attention
class ConsciousnessTracker:
    def __init__(self):
        self.attention_allocation = EconomicAttention()
        self.global_workspace = GlobalWorkspace()
```

### Lightweight Alternative

If full cognitive architectures are too heavy:

```python
class SimplifiedCognitiveModel:
    """
    Extract key concepts without full framework
    """
    def __init__(self):
        # From ACT-R: Activation equations
        self.activation = ActivationCalculator()
        
        # From CLARION: Dual representation
        self.dual_rep = DualRepresentation()
        
        # From OpenCog: Attention economy
        self.attention = AttentionEconomy()
        
        # From Soar: Goal stack
        self.goals = GoalStack()
```

## ‚úÖ Conclusion

For Prometheus v3's cognitive modeling:

1. **Extract Key Concepts**: Don't implement full architectures
2. **Memory from ACT-R**: Use activation equations
3. **Dual-Process from CLARION**: Implicit/explicit distinction
4. **Consciousness from OpenCog**: Attention allocation
5. **Goals from Soar**: Problem-space organization

This approach provides cognitive realism without overwhelming complexity, enabling sophisticated modeling of learning and consciousness evolution.
