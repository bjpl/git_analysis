# Predictive Anomaly Paradigm

## Definition
A proactive monitoring paradigm that uses machine learning to predict anomalies before they occur, shifting from reactive detection to preventive action through continuous learning from system behaviors.

## Core Principles

### 1. Temporal Pattern Learning
- Learn normal behavior patterns over time
- Identify seasonal and cyclical variations
- Detect subtle drift in baseline metrics

### 2. Multi-Signal Correlation
```yaml
signal_fusion:
  inputs:
    - metrics: CPU, memory, disk I/O
    - logs: Error rates, warning patterns
    - traces: Latency distributions, dependency maps
  output:
    - prediction: Anomaly probability in next time window
    - confidence: Statistical confidence level
    - impact: Predicted service degradation
```

### 3. Continuous Model Evolution
- Self-supervised learning from system behavior
- Automatic retraining on new patterns
- Feedback incorporation from false positives/negatives

## Learning Mechanisms

### 1. Time Series Forecasting
```python
class AnomalyPredictor:
    def learn_patterns(self, historical_data):
        # Learn multiple timescales
        patterns = {
            "short_term": self.learn_hourly_patterns(historical_data),
            "daily": self.learn_daily_patterns(historical_data),
            "weekly": self.learn_weekly_patterns(historical_data),
            "seasonal": self.learn_seasonal_patterns(historical_data)
        }

        # Combine patterns for prediction
        self.ensemble_model = self.build_ensemble(patterns)

        # Set dynamic thresholds
        self.thresholds = self.calculate_adaptive_thresholds(
            patterns,
            sensitivity=self.config.sensitivity
        )
```

### 2. Causal Learning
- Identify cause-effect relationships
- Build dependency graphs automatically
- Predict cascade failures

### 3. Transfer Learning
- Apply learned patterns across similar systems
- Share models between environments
- Rapid adaptation to new deployments

## Implementation Strategy

### Phase 1: Statistical Baselines
- Establish normal behavior profiles
- Simple statistical anomaly detection
- Manual threshold tuning

### Phase 2: ML-Enhanced Detection
- Auto-regressive models for prediction
- Ensemble methods for robustness
- Automated threshold adjustment

### Phase 3: Deep Learning Integration
- Neural networks for complex patterns
- Attention mechanisms for importance weighting
- Generative models for scenario simulation

## Success Metrics
- Prediction Accuracy: >90% for 1-hour horizon
- False Positive Rate: <5%
- Lead Time: Average 30 minutes before incident
- Learning Speed: <24 hours to adapt to new patterns
