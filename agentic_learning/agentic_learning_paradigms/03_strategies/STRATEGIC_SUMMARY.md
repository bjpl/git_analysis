# 🎯 Strategic Options Summary - Agentic Learning System
## *Updated with Evidence-Based Research Integration*

## 🔬 Research-Informed Priorities

Based on meta-analysis of learning techniques and Oxford's strategy framework:
1. **Practice Testing** (d = 0.70-1.50) - MUST HAVE in every implementation
2. **Distributed Practice** (d = 0.40-0.90) - Core scheduling feature
3. **Elaborative Interrogation** (d = 0.40-0.75) - AI questioning system
4. **Self-Explanation** (d = 0.35-0.65) - Metacognitive prompts

## 5 Implementation Paths (Evidence-Enhanced)

### 🚀 Option 1: MVP Sprint - Prometheus Personal Companion [RECOMMENDED]
