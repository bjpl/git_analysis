- 40% overall adoption rate

### Phase 3: Intelligence (Months 7-12)
**Goal**: Autonomous monitoring assistant

#### Technical Implementation
```python
# Intelligent monitoring assistant
class Phase3Implementation:
    autonomous_features = {
        "self_investigation": "Automatic anomaly investigation",
        "narrative_generation": "Natural language reports",
        "predictive_queries": "Anticipate user needs",
        "cross_team_learning": "Shared knowledge base"
    }

    advanced_capabilities = [
        "Generate investigation summaries",
        "Predict next user query",
        "Auto-investigate anomalies",
        "Create incident narratives"
    ]
```

#### Deployment Steps
1. **Month 7-8**: Deploy autonomous investigation
2. **Month 9-10**: Implement narrative generation
3. **Month 11-12**: Full production rollout

#### Success Criteria
