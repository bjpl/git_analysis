            local_model = deployment.train_local_model()
            local_models.append(local_model.weights)

        # Aggregate models
        global_model = self.federated_averaging(local_models)

        # Distribute updated model
        for deployment in self.deployments:
            deployment.update_model(global_model)
```

        """,
        "meta_learning": """
            Learn how to learn new patterns
            more efficiently
        """
    }

    def apply_transfer_learning(self, source_domain, target_domain):
        # Extract transferable features
        shared_features = self.identify_shared_patterns(
            source_domain, target_domain
        )

        # Fine-tune for target domain
        adapted_model = self.fine_tune(
            base_model=source_domain.model,
            target_data=target_domain.limited_data,
            freeze_layers=self.determine_frozen_layers()
