## Performance

- Thumbnails are generated on-demand and cached
- Background scanning for non-blocking imports
- Efficient SQLite queries for fast searching
- Lazy loading for large image collections

## Future Enhancements

- Export collections to folders/archives
- Advanced duplicate detection with perceptual hashing
- Facial recognition and auto-tagging
- Cloud storage integration
- Image editing tools
- Slideshow mode
- Metadata EXIF reading/writing

## Requirements

- Python 3.8+
- Tkinter (included with Python)
- Pillow (PIL) for image processing
