# Internet Infrastructure Map - Update Documentation

## Recent Updates (2025-09-11)

### 1. Enhanced Arc Rendering for Long-Distance Cables

#### Problem Solved
- Ultra-long submarine cables (transpacific, transatlantic) were having their arcs cut off by the globe surface
- Arc heights were insufficient for cables over 15,000 km

#### Implementation
**File: `src/main-clean.js`**
- Implemented dynamic arc altitude scaling based on cable distance:
  - Ultra-long cables (>15,000 km): 0.5-0.7 altitude with progressive scaling
  - Transpacific cables (>10,000 km): 0.35 altitude
  - Long distance (>5,000 km): 0.25 altitude
  - Regional cables: Progressive lower arcs (0.15, 0.08, 0.04)
- Added `arcCurveResolution: 64` for smoother arc rendering
- Adjusted camera settings: `maxDistance: 500` for better viewing angles

**File: `src/cableRenderer.js`**
- Created `GreatCircleArcCurve` class with proper elevation calculation
- Arc height scales up to 50% of globe radius for longest cables
- Increased curve resolution: 100 points for >10,000 km cables
- Smooth sine-based elevation factor for natural-looking arcs

### 2. Information Tooltips for Filter Controls

#### Features Added
Added clickable info icons (ℹ️) with detailed explanations for:

**Major Cables Filter**
- Definition: Cables with >100 Tbps capacity
- Lists strategic cables: MAREA, Grace Hopper, 2Africa, Dunant, FASTER
- Explains these carry majority of international traffic

**Cable Capacity Classifications**
- **High (>150 Tbps)**: Latest generation, 15+ million HD streams
- **Medium (50-150 Tbps)**: Modern backbone, 5-15 million HD streams
- **Low (<50 Tbps)**: Older/regional cables, still critical
- Reference: 1 Tbps = 100,000 HD video streams

**Data Center Tier System**
- **Tier 1**: Major hubs, 100+ carriers, 99.995% uptime (Singapore, Frankfurt, Ashburn)
- **Tier 2**: Regional centers, 20-100 carriers, 99.98% uptime
- **Tier 3**: Local facilities, 5-20 carriers, edge computing

#### Implementation Details
**File: `index.html`**
- Added info icons next to filter controls
- Created tooltip containers with detailed explanations
- Structured content with headers, lists, and notes

**File: `src/styles.css`**
- Added `.info-icon` styling with hover effects
- Created `.info-tooltip` with backdrop blur and shadow effects
- Responsive tooltip design with max-width constraints

**File: `src/main-clean.js`**
- Added `setupInfoTooltips()` method
- Smart tooltip toggle (only one visible at a time)
- Click outside to close functionality
- Close button handlers for each tooltip

## Technical Improvements

### Performance
- Higher arc curve resolution for smoother rendering
- Optimized point calculation for cable curves
- Improved camera near/far plane settings

### User Experience
- Info tooltips provide educational context
- Professional dark theme with consistent styling
- Smooth transitions and hover effects
- Responsive design for various screen sizes

## Files Modified

### Core Files
- `index.html` - Added info icons and tooltip containers
- `src/main-clean.js` - Enhanced arc calculations and tooltip handlers
- `src/cableRenderer.js` - Improved cable curve rendering
- `src/styles.css` - Added tooltip styling

### Key Changes
1. Dynamic arc altitude based on cable distance
2. Info tooltips for Major Cables, Capacities, and Tiers
3. Improved curve resolution for long cables
4. Better camera positioning for arc visibility

## Testing Notes
- Tested with transpacific cables (>15,000 km)
- Verified arc visibility at various zoom levels
- Confirmed tooltip functionality across all info icons
- Validated responsive design at different screen sizes

## Future Considerations
- Could add tooltips for other controls (regions, BGP, etc.)
- Possible animation for arc rendering
- Additional data accuracy indicators
- Performance monitoring integration
