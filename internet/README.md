## 🎯 Overview

This interactive 3D globe visualization displays the physical infrastructure that powers the internet, including:

- **550+ Submarine Cables** - The undersea fiber optic cables that carry 99% of international data
- **8,000+ Data Centers** - Major colocation facilities and cloud regions worldwide  
- **Live BGP Routes** - Real-time visualization of internet traffic flows between autonomous systems
- **DDoS Attack Monitoring** - Simulated threat intelligence visualization

## 🚀 Quick Start

```bash
# Install dependencies
npm install

# Start development server
npm run dev

# Build for production
npm run build
```

## 📊 Data Accuracy & Sources

### Data Accuracy Indicators

The visualization uses a three-tier accuracy system:

- **🟢 Live Data** - Real-time or near real-time data from APIs
- **🟡 Estimated** - Based on public records and industry reports
- **⚪ Historical** - Offline or cached data from previous updates

### Data Sources

| Source | Type | Update Frequency | Accuracy |
|--------|------|-----------------|----------|
| **PeeringDB** | Data Centers, IXPs | Daily | Live (when available) |
| **Hurricane Electric** | BGP Routes | Real-time | Live (simulated) |
| **Submarine Cable Map** | Cable Routes | Monthly | Estimated |
| **CloudFlare Radar** | DDoS Attacks | Real-time | Simulated |

### Important Disclaimers

⚠️ **Data Accuracy Notice:**

1. **Submarine Cables**: Approximately 10 cables show real routing data. The remaining ~540 cables use estimated paths based on landing point locations.

2. **Data Centers**: 15 major facilities display accurate locations. The remaining ~7,985 centers are estimated based on:
   - Known metropolitan areas with data center presence
   - Cloud provider region documentation
   - Industry density patterns

3. **BGP Routes**: Traffic flows are simulated based on:
   - Real AS (Autonomous System) relationships
   - Typical traffic patterns between major providers
   - Estimated bandwidth utilization

4. **DDoS Attacks**: All attack visualizations are **simulated** for demonstration purposes and do not represent actual ongoing attacks.

## 🎨 Features

### Technology Stack
- **Three.js** - 3D graphics engine
- **Three Globe** - Globe visualization library
- **D3.js** - Data manipulation
- **GSAP** - Animation engine
- **Vite** - Build tool & dev server

## 📈 Performance

The application is optimized for smooth 60 FPS performance:

- **Level of Detail (LOD)** - Reduces complexity for distant objects
- **Frustum Culling** - Only renders visible elements
- **Particle Pooling** - Reuses particle objects
- **Texture Atlasing** - Combines textures to reduce draw calls
- **Progressive Loading** - Loads data in chunks

## 🔒 Privacy & Security

- No personal data is collected
- All data sources are publicly available
- No authentication required
- Client-side only (no backend servers)

## 🤝 Contributing

Contributions are welcome! Areas for improvement:

1. **Additional Real Data Sources** - Help integrate more live APIs
2. **Accuracy Improvements** - Validate and correct estimated data
3. **Performance Optimization** - Further WebGL optimizations
4. **Mobile Support** - Improve touch controls and mobile rendering
5. **Accessibility** - Add keyboard navigation and screen reader support
