- **Real-time data** could show actual internet traffic patterns
- **Procedural generation** based on your knowledge base data

### Example Journey:
```
User clicks "Send Email" → 
Watch a glowing packet leave Email Client Building →
Travel through SMTP Highway →
Stop at DNS Intersection for directions →
Enter Internet Service Provider Gateway →
Journey across BGP Interstate System →
Arrive at Gmail Data Center
```
