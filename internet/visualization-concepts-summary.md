## Data Accuracy Analysis

### Highly Accurate & Available
✅ **Can definitely show:**
- Submarine cable locations and specifications (TeleGeography)
- Major data center locations (public databases)
- BGP routing data (RouteViews, RIPE RIS)
- DNS resolver paths (traceable)
- Your packet paths via traceroute
- Protocol handshakes and negotiations
- Certificate chains and validation
- IPv6 adoption rates (Google, APNIC data)
- Internet exchange points (PeeringDB)
- CDN PoP locations (published by providers)
- Latency measurements (RIPE Atlas, M-Lab)

### Partially Accurate/Estimated
⚠️ **Can approximate:**
- Live DDoS attacks (some public feeds, incomplete picture)
- Real-time traffic volumes (must interpolate from available data)
- Some data center ownership (many confidential)
- Data travel distance (assumes great-circle paths)
- Carbon footprint (based on averages)
- Cable capacity utilization (estimates only)
- Cost data (only for your own accounts)

### Difficult/Impossible to Access
❌ **Cannot accurately show:**
- Other users' personal traffic (privacy)
- Exact terrestrial fiber routes (security sensitive)
- Real-time cable breaks (usually delayed reporting)
- ISP internal routing (proprietary)
- Actual peering agreement details (NDAs)
- Inside encrypted tunnels
- Government surveillance infrastructure

## Implementation Recommendations

### Most Feasible Starting Points

1. **Highest Accuracy Option**: Live Internet Infrastructure Map
   - 90% accurate with real cable, IXP, and data center data
   - Clear value proposition
   - Public data sources available

2. **Most Personal Impact**: Personal Internet Footprint Analyzer
   - 75% accurate for individual users
   - Creates "aha" moments about personal usage
   - Privacy-respecting local analysis

3. **Best Educational Value**: Protocol Debugger & Analyzer
   - 100% accurate for protocols you control
   - Directly useful for learning and debugging
   - Builds on existing DevTools paradigm

### Honest Framing Guidelines
- Label estimates clearly: "Estimated distance: ~15,000 miles"
- Show confidence levels: "High confidence" vs "Approximation"
- Explain data sources: "Based on public BGP data"
