    {
        "title": "Peripheral Scan:",
        "activity": ("Activity: In a setting such as a bus stop or park, allow your gaze to relax and scan the edges of your vision. "
                     "Notice subtle movements like birds taking flight or branches swaying in the breeze."),
        "explanation": ("Explanation: This exercise trains you to expand your field of awareness beyond a narrow focus. "
                        "By learning to capture peripheral details, you become sensitive to nuances that often go unnoticed, "
                        "thereby enhancing your overall environmental perception.")
    },
    {
        "title": "Soundscape Sampling:",
        "activity": ("Activity: In locations like coffee shops or train stations, sit quietly and listen to the mix of background sounds - "
                     "distant conversations, ambient music, traffic hum, and natural sounds. Avoid zeroing in on a single source."),
        "explanation": ("Explanation: The goal is to develop an ear for complex sound layers, learning to differentiate and appreciate "
                        "the subtleties within the auditory environment. This improves your ability to notice shifts in tone and ambient "
                        "sound quality over time.")

        "title": "Light & Shadow Play:",
        "activity": ("Activity: Observe how light interacts with your surroundings, noting how shadows shift as the day progresses or as you move. "
                     "For example, watch how a lamppost's shadow drifts across a pavement."),
        "explanation": ("Explanation: This exercise sharpens your ability to see dynamic visual effects created by light. It helps you understand "
                        "how changes in illumination can alter the mood or character of an environment, emphasizing the transient nature of visual details.")
    },
    {
        "title": "Spatial Layout Insight:",
        "activity": ("Activity: Choose a static environment such as a caf√© or museum. Mentally map the space - its layout, seating, decor, and focal points. "
                     "Sketch a rough diagram to capture your perception of the space."),
        "explanation": ("Explanation: This activity develops your ability to construct an internal blueprint of an environment. It reinforces spatial awareness "
                        "by challenging you to note structural details and the arrangement of objects, which can inform how people interact within that space.")

                     "in ambiance such as temperature, lighting, and sound. Record your observations in a journal or quick sketch."),
        "explanation": ("Explanation: This exercise focuses on dynamic shifts rather than static details. It encourages you to be attentive to the subtle cues "
                        "that mark the boundary between different environments, deepening your understanding of how transitions impact perception.")
