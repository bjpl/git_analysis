# Development Patterns Observed Across All Projects:
# 
# 1. Strong Initial Commits: Most projects start with substantial functionality
# 2. Authentication Challenges: Common theme across multiple projects
# 3. UI/UX Iteration: Significant time spent on tooltip/interaction refinement
# 4. Performance Focus: Consistent optimization efforts
# 5. Documentation: Comprehensive docs created early or late, rarely in middle
# 6. Technology Choices: Preference for modern, well-supported frameworks
# 7. Cost Consciousness: Multiple projects emphasize zero/low-cost infrastructure
