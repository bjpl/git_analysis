## 🔧 Identified Bottlenecks

### Technical Debt
1. **Empty Coordination Directories**
   - memory_bank/ needs shared knowledge storage
   - orchestration/ needs workflow templates
   - subtasks/ needs task dependencies

2. **Configuration Gaps**
   - Missing JSON schema validation
   - No error recovery mechanisms
   - Limited health monitoring

3. **Testing Gaps**
   - Legacy projects lack testing
   - Inconsistent coverage requirements
   - Missing performance benchmarks

## 💡 Strategic Recommendations

### Immediate Actions (24-48 hours)
1. **Version Control Recovery**
   ```bash
   git branch backup-before-cleanup
   git stash
   # Archive deleted projects separately
   # Then commit or revert changes
   ```

2. **Repository Alignment**
   ```bash
   git remote set-url origin <correct-repository>
   # OR create new repository for workspace
   ```

3. **Fix Claude-Flow Wrapper**
   ```json
   // Add to package.json
   {
     "type": "module"
   }
   ```

### Short-term Improvements (1 week)
1. **Populate Coordination Structure**
   ```
   coordination/
   ├── memory_bank/
   │   ├── shared_knowledge.json
   │   ├── agent_relationships.json
   │   └── task_history.json
   ├── orchestration/
   │   ├── workflow_templates.json
   │   ├── topology_configs.json
   │   └── coordination_rules.json
   └── subtasks/
       ├── active_tasks.json
       └── task_dependencies.json
   ```

2. **Implement Health Monitoring**
   ```javascript
   {
     "system": {
       "health": "healthy",
       "uptime": 0,
       "last_health_check": null,
       "error_count": 0
     }
   }
   ```

3. **Standardize Testing**
