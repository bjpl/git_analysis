# Non-Blocking Configuration Manager Fix

This directory contains a fix for the blocking `ensure_api_keys_configured` function in the original `config_manager.py`. The original implementation uses `wait_window()` which blocks the main thread, preventing the main application window from rendering until the setup wizard is completed.

## Files

- `config_manager_fix.py` - Non-blocking configuration manager implementation
- `demo_non_blocking_config.py` - Demonstration application showing the fix in action
- `README.md` - This documentation file

## The Problem

The original `ensure_api_keys_configured()` function in `config_manager.py` uses:

```python
wizard = SetupWizard(parent, config)
parent.wait_window(wizard)  # This blocks the main thread!
```

This blocking behavior causes:
- Main window doesn't render until setup is complete
- Application appears frozen during configuration
- Poor user experience, especially on first run
- No way to interact with the main app while configuring

## The Solution

The non-blocking version provides three main improvements:

### 1. Non-Blocking Setup Wizard

```python
# Non-modal wizard that doesn't block the main thread
class NonBlockingSetupWizard(tk.Toplevel):
    def __init__(self, parent, config_manager, completion_callback=None):
        super().__init__(parent)
        # Remove grab_set() - allows main window to remain interactive
        self.transient(parent)  # Still associated with parent
        # ... rest of implementation
```

### 2. Asynchronous Configuration Check

```python
def ensure_api_keys_configured_async(parent_window=None, completion_callback=None):
    """
    Non-blocking version that uses callbacks instead of waiting.
    Returns immediately, calls completion_callback when done.
    """
    return _wizard_manager.show_wizard_if_needed(parent_window, completion_callback)
```

### 3. Wizard Manager to Prevent Duplicates

```python
class SetupWizardManager:
    """Prevents multiple wizards and manages active instances."""
    def show_wizard_if_needed(self, parent_window=None, completion_callback=None):
        # Only creates wizard if keys missing and no wizard active
        # Brings existing wizard to front if already open
```

## Usage Examples

### Basic Non-Blocking Usage

```python
from config_manager_fix import ensure_api_keys_configured_async

def setup_complete_callback(result, config_manager):
    if result is True:
        print("Configuration successful!")
        # Use config_manager for API calls
    elif result == 'skipped':
        print("User skipped configuration")
        # App can still run with limited functionality
    else:
        print("Configuration cancelled")

# This call returns immediately - doesn't block
config = ensure_api_keys_configured_async(main_window, setup_complete_callback)

if config:
    # Keys were already configured
    print("Already configured!")
else:
    # Wizard was shown, callback will be called when done
    print("Wizard shown, main app continues running...")
```

### Threaded Version for Maximum Responsiveness

```python
from config_manager_fix import ensure_api_keys_configured_threaded

# Even the config check runs in a background thread
ensure_api_keys_configured_threaded(main_window, setup_complete_callback)
```

### Integration with Existing Code

For existing applications, you can gradually migrate:

```python
# Old blocking way (not recommended)
config = ensure_api_keys_configured(main_window)

# New non-blocking way
def handle_config_result(result, config_manager):
    if result:
        # Continue with application logic
        start_main_features(config_manager)
    else:
        # Handle no configuration gracefully
        show_limited_mode()

ensure_api_keys_configured_async(main_window, handle_config_result)
```

## Key Features

### 1. Non-Modal Dialog
- Main window remains interactive
- User can move/resize both windows
- No application "freeze" during setup

### 2. Skip Option
- Users can skip configuration and set up later
- Application can run in limited mode
- Better first-run experience

### 3. Duplicate Prevention
- Only one setup wizard at a time
- Existing wizard brought to front if user clicks setup again
- Prevents UI confusion

### 4. Callback-Based Design
- Clean separation of concerns
- Easy to integrate with existing async patterns
- Supports different result types (success, skipped, cancelled)

### 5. Backward Compatibility
- Original blocking function still available
- Gradual migration path for existing code
- Same ConfigManager class interface

## Testing the Fix

Run the demonstration:

```bash
cd src/fixes
python demo_non_blocking_config.py
```

The demo shows:
- Counter continues updating (proves app isn't frozen)
- Main window remains interactive
- Setup wizard can be opened/closed without blocking
- Multiple setup attempts handled gracefully

## Integration Steps

1. **Import the fixed version:**
   ```python
   from src.fixes.config_manager_fix import ensure_api_keys_configured_async, ConfigManager
   ```

2. **Replace blocking calls:**
   ```python
   # OLD
   config = ensure_api_keys_configured(main_window)
   if config:
       start_app(config)
   
   # NEW
   def start_when_ready(result, config_manager):
       if result:
           start_app(config_manager)
       else:
           show_setup_reminder()
   
   ensure_api_keys_configured_async(main_window, start_when_ready)
   ```

3. **Handle different result types:**
   ```python
   def handle_setup(result, config_manager):
       if result is True:
           # Success - keys saved and validated
           enable_all_features(config_manager)
       elif result == 'skipped':
           # User chose to skip - partial functionality
           enable_basic_features()
           show_setup_reminder_later()
       else:
           # Cancelled - user closed wizard
           show_welcome_screen()
   ```

## Benefits

- **Better UX**: No more frozen application during setup
- **Flexible**: Users can skip and configure later
- **Responsive**: Main app remains fully interactive
- **Robust**: Handles multiple setup attempts gracefully
- **Compatible**: Easy to integrate with existing code

## Migration Notes

- The `ConfigManager` class itself is unchanged
- Only the wizard display mechanism is non-blocking
- All configuration file operations remain the same
- API key validation and storage logic is identical
