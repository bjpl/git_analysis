The application stores data in the `data/` directory:
- `session_log.json`: Complete session history
- `vocabulary.csv`: Extracted Spanish-English word pairs

## Building from Source

To create your own executable:

1. Install PyInstaller:
```bash
pip install pyinstaller
```

2. Build the executable:
```bash
# Windows
build.bat

# Linux/Mac
./build.sh
```

The executable will be created in the `dist/` directory.
