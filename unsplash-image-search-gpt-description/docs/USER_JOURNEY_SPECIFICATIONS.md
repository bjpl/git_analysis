## Critical User Flows

### Flow 1: Image Search to Vocabulary Collection

**Steps:**
1. User enters search query (e.g., "beach vacation")
2. System displays Unsplash image results
3. User selects preferred image
4. User adds optional context notes
5. System generates Spanish description using GPT-4
6. User clicks Spanish words/phrases for translations
7. Selected vocabulary automatically saved to personal collection
8. System updates learning statistics and progress

**Alternative Flows:**
- **A1:** No search results found
  - System suggests alternative search terms
  - User modifies query or tries suggested terms
  
- **A2:** AI description fails to generate
  - System provides fallback using cached responses
  - User can retry or skip to next image

**Error Handling:**
- API timeouts: Show retry button with explanation
- Network errors: Enable offline mode with cached content
- Invalid search terms: Provide search suggestions

### Flow 2: Spaced Repetition Quiz System

**Steps:**
1. System calculates due vocabulary using spaced repetition algorithm
2. User receives push notification (if enabled) about due reviews
3. User opens quiz interface showing progress (e.g., "5/20 words due")
4. System presents vocabulary in optimal review order
5. User responds to translation/definition prompts
6. System adjusts difficulty and next review date based on performance
7. Completion screen shows session statistics and progress

**Adaptive Logic:**
- Correct answers → increase interval (SM-2 algorithm)
- Incorrect answers → reset to shorter interval  
- Consistent accuracy → advance difficulty level
- Multiple errors → suggest focused practice

### Flow 3: Social Vocabulary Sharing

**Steps:**
1. User selects vocabulary items to share
2. User creates collection name and description
3. User sets sharing permissions (public/private/specific users)
4. System generates shareable link or QR code
5. Recipients access shared collection
6. Recipients can study but not modify original
7. Owner receives statistics on collection usage

**Privacy Controls:**
- Default to private sharing
- Individual vocabulary item privacy settings
- Revoke access to shared collections
- Export shared collections for backup

## Mobile-Specific Considerations

### Touch Interactions
- **Tap:** Primary selection and navigation
- **Long Press:** Context menus and additional options

### Screen Adaptations

- **Landscape Mode:** Side-by-side image and text panels
- **Small Screens (< 375px):** Single-column layout with slide-over panels
- **Large Screens (> 768px):** Multi-column layout with persistent navigation

### Performance Optimizations
- **Progressive Image Loading:** Load thumbnails first, full resolution on demand

- **Lazy Loading:** Load content as user scrolls
- **Touch Response:** < 100ms feedback for all touch interactions

## Accessibility Requirements
