## Troubleshooting

### Common Testing Issues

#### Issue: Smoke Tests Fail - Application Won't Start
**Symptoms**: Executable launches but immediately crashes
**Diagnosis**:
```bash
# Check for missing dependencies
python scripts/dependency_checker.py dist/main.exe

# Run in verbose mode
dist/main.exe --verbose --debug

# Check system compatibility
python scripts/system_compatibility.py
```
**Solutions**:
- Rebuild with all dependencies included
- Check for conflicting system libraries
- Verify Python interpreter embedding
- Test on clean system without dev tools

#### Issue: API Tests Fail Due to Network
**Symptoms**: All API-related tests timeout or fail
**Diagnosis**:
```bash
# Test network connectivity
ping api.unsplash.com
ping api.openai.com

# Check proxy settings
echo $HTTP_PROXY $HTTPS_PROXY

# Test with curl
curl -I https://api.unsplash.com/search/photos
```
**Solutions**:
- Configure proxy settings if needed
- Use mock tests for CI/CD environments
- Implement retry logic with exponential backoff
- Add network connectivity checks

#### Issue: UI Tests Fail on Different Screen Resolutions
**Symptoms**: UI interaction tests work on development machine but fail in CI
**Diagnosis**:
```python
# Check screen resolution
import pyautogui
print(f"Screen size: {pyautogui.size()}")

# Check available displays
import tkinter as tk
root = tk.Tk()
print(f"Screen: {root.winfo_screenwidth()}x{root.winfo_screenheight()}")
```
**Solutions**:
- Use relative positioning instead of absolute coordinates
- Add screen size detection and adaptation
- Test on multiple resolutions
- Use virtual display for headless environments

#### Issue: Memory Tests Show False Positives
**Symptoms**: Memory usage appears to grow but is actually normal
**Diagnosis**:
```python
# Distinguish between different memory types
import psutil
process = psutil.Process()
memory = process.memory_info()
print(f"RSS: {memory.rss}, VMS: {memory.vms}")
print(f"Memory percent: {process.memory_percent()}")
```
**Solutions**:
- Use RSS (Resident Set Size) instead of VMS
- Account for normal garbage collection patterns
- Run longer tests to see true trends
- Compare with baseline measurements

### Testing Environment Setup

#### Development Environment
```bash
# Install all testing dependencies
pip install -r requirements-dev.txt

# Install UI automation tools (Windows)
pip install pyautogui pygetwindow

# Install system monitoring tools
pip install psutil

# Setup test data directories
mkdir -p test_data/images test_data/configs test_data/exports
```

#### CI/CD Environment
```yaml
# GitHub Actions setup for testing
- name: Setup test environment
  run: |
    # Install dependencies
    pip install -r requirements-dev.txt
    
    # Setup virtual display for UI tests (Linux)
    sudo apt-get install xvfb
    export DISPLAY=:99
    Xvfb :99 -screen 0 1024x768x24 > /dev/null 2>&1 &
    
    # Create test directories
    mkdir -p test_results test_data
```
