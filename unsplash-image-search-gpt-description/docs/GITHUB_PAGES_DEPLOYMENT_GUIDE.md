# GitHub Pages Deployment Guide

## 🚀 Deployment Status: Ready for GitHub Pages

Your VocabLens PWA is now configured for immediate GitHub Pages deployment. Here's what has been implemented and the next steps to complete the deployment.

## ✅ Completed Configuration

### 1. Package Configuration
- ✅ Added `gh-pages` dependency to `package.json`
- ✅ Added deployment scripts:
  - `deploy:github` - Full deployment process
  - `github:prepare` - Creates 404.html for SPA routing
  - `predeploy:github` - Pre-deployment build

### 2. Vite Configuration
- ✅ Updated `vite.config.ts` with GitHub Pages base path
- ✅ Base path automatically set to `/vocablens-pwa/` when `GITHUB_PAGES=true`
- ✅ PWA manifest configured for GitHub Pages deployment

### 3. SPA Routing Support
- ✅ Created deployment preparation script
- ✅ 404.html automatically created from index.html for client-side routing
- ✅ Configured for React Router compatibility

### 4. GitHub Actions Workflow
- ✅ Created `.github/workflows/deploy-github-pages.yml`
- ✅ Automated build and deployment on push to main branch
- ✅ Proper Node.js 20+ setup for modern Vite compatibility
- ✅ Environment variable configuration for GitHub Pages

## 🎯 Next Steps to Complete Deployment

### Step 1: Enable GitHub Pages in Repository Settings
1. Go to your repository: https://github.com/bjpl/vocablens-pwa
2. Navigate to **Settings** → **Pages**
3. Under **Source**, select **GitHub Actions**
4. The workflow will automatically deploy on the next push

### Step 2: Push Changes to Trigger Deployment
```bash
git add .
git commit -m "Add GitHub Pages deployment configuration"
git push origin main
```

### Step 3: Manual Deployment (Alternative)
If you prefer manual deployment:
```bash
npm run deploy:github
```

## 🔧 Configuration Details

### Environment Variables
The deployment uses the `GITHUB_PAGES=true` environment variable to:
- Set the correct base path (`/vocablens-pwa/`)
- Configure asset paths for GitHub Pages
- Enable production optimizations

### Base Path Configuration
```typescript
// vite.config.ts
export default defineConfig({
  base: process.env.GITHUB_PAGES ? '/vocablens-pwa/' : '/',
  // ... rest of config
});
```

### Deployment Scripts
```json
{
  "deploy:github": "npm run build && npm run github:prepare && gh-pages -d dist",
  "github:prepare": "copy dist\\index.html dist\\404.html",
  "predeploy:github": "npm run build"
}
```

## 🌐 Expected Deployment URL
Once deployed, your app will be available at:
**https://bjpl.github.io/vocablens-pwa/**

## 🚨 Important Notes

### Node.js Version Requirement
- The project requires Node.js 20.19+ or 22.12+
- Current environment has Node.js 20.11.0 (needs upgrade)
- GitHub Actions workflow uses Node.js 20 (compatible)

### Build Dependencies
- All necessary dependencies are configured
- `gh-pages` package added for manual deployment
- GitHub Actions handles automated deployment

### SPA Routing
- 404.html trick implemented for client-side routing
- All routes will be handled by React Router
- No server-side configuration needed

## 🔍 Troubleshooting

### If Manual Deployment Fails
1. Ensure you have push access to the repository
2. Check that `gh-pages` branch is created
3. Verify GitHub token permissions

### If Automated Deployment Fails
1. Check GitHub Actions tab for error logs
2. Ensure repository has Pages enabled
3. Verify workflow permissions

### Build Issues
1. Upgrade Node.js to 20.19+ or 22.12+
2. Run `npm install` to update dependencies
3. Check for TypeScript compilation errors

## 📊 Deployment Verification

After deployment, verify:
- [ ] Site loads at the GitHub Pages URL
- [ ] All routes work (About, Search, Quiz, etc.)
- [ ] PWA features function correctly
- [ ] Assets load with correct base path
- [ ] No 404 errors in browser console

## 🎉 Success!

Your VocabLens PWA is now ready for immediate GitHub Pages deployment. This provides a reliable, free hosting solution while other deployment platforms are being debugged.
