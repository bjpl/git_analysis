## API Key Management & Security

### Current Approach (Desktop)
- API keys stored locally in config files
- User manages their own keys
- No intermediate server exposure
- Keys never leave user's machine

### Web Security Challenges

#### Frontend Key Exposure
**Problem**: Cannot store API keys in browser client
**Solutions:**
1. **Backend Proxy**: Server handles all API calls
2. **User Account System**: Each user stores encrypted keys
3. **Shared Service Keys**: Application provides the service

#### Proposed Security Architecture

```
Browser Client → Backend API → External APIs (Unsplash/OpenAI)
     ↑              ↑               ↑
   User Auth    Encrypted Keys   Rate Limiting
```

**Implementation Details:**
- JWT-based authentication
- API keys encrypted at rest (AES-256)
- Rate limiting per user
- Request validation and sanitization
- HTTPS everywhere

### Key Management Options

#### Option 1: User-Managed Keys
**Pros:** Users control their own costs and limits
**Cons:** Complex setup, technical barrier for users

#### Option 2: Application-Provided Service
**Pros:** Seamless user experience
**Cons:** High operational costs, usage limits needed

#### Option 3: Freemium Model
**Pros:** Free tier with paid upgrades
**Cons:** Complex billing, cost prediction difficult

### Recommendation: Hybrid Model
- Free tier with application keys (limited usage)
- Premium tier for user-managed keys (unlimited)
- Clear usage tracking and billing

## User Accessibility & Reach

### Current Desktop Limitations
- Windows-only executable (though Python cross-platform)
- Requires download and installation
- Limited by local system resources
- No mobile support
- Version update management

### Web Advantages

#### Universal Access
- **Cross-Platform**: Works on any device with browser
