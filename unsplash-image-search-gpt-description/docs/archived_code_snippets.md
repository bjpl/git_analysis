# Archived Code Snippets

This file contains useful code snippets from duplicate files that were deleted for security reasons.

## From main_fixes.py

The following fixes were identified in main_fixes.py but are already implemented in the main codebase:

1. **Better prompts for image analysis** - Already implemented in main.py
2. **URL verification** - Already implemented via retry logic in main.py  
3. **Image cache** - Not implemented but could be added as enhancement
4. **Better status messages** - Already implemented in main.py
5. **Smarter phrase extraction** - Already implemented in main.py

## Security Note

The files main_original.py, main_updated.py, and main_fixes.py were deleted because:
- main_original.py contained hardcoded API keys (CRITICAL security risk)
- main_updated.py and main_fixes.py were duplicate code that could confuse developers
- All functionality has been properly implemented in main.py using secure configuration management

## Future Enhancements from Archived Code

If needed, these enhancements from main_fixes.py could be implemented:

```python
# Simple image cache to avoid re-downloading
class SimpleImageCache:
    def __init__(self, max_size=10):
        self.cache = {}
        self.order = []
        self.max_size = max_size
    
    def get(self, url):
        return self.cache.get(url)
    
    def put(self, url, image_data):
        if url in self.cache:
            return
        if len(self.order) >= self.max_size:
            old_url = self.order.pop(0)
            del self.cache[old_url]
        self.cache[url] = image_data
        self.order.append(url)
```
