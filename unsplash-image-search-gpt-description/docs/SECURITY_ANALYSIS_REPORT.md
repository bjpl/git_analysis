- **CVSS Score**: 6.5 (Medium)

#### Network Request Interception
- **Risk**: Keys exposed in HTTP headers or query parameters
- **Impact**: Network-level credential compromise
- **Probability**: Medium (requires network access)
- **CVSS Score**: 6.2 (Medium)

#### Insufficient Key Rotation
- **Risk**: Long-lived credentials increase exposure window
- **Impact**: Extended unauthorized access if compromised
- **Probability**: High (manual process often neglected)
- **CVSS Score**: 5.8 (Medium)

### 2.3 LOW SEVERITY RISKS

#### Source Code Analysis
- **Risk**: Keys discoverable through static code analysis
- **Impact**: Automated credential harvesting

- **Probability**: Low (requires physical access)
- **CVSS Score**: 3.9 (Low)

## 3. Recommended Security Implementation

### 3.1 Client-Side Encryption Architecture

#### Web Crypto API Implementation
```typescript
// Implemented in src/services/secureApiKeyStorage.ts
- AES-GCM encryption with 256-bit keys
- PBKDF2 key derivation (100,000 iterations)
- Cryptographically secure random IV/salt generation
- 15-minute master key caching for performance
- Automatic key rotation reminders
```

**Security Benefits:**
- Military-grade encryption (AES-256)
- Keys never stored in plaintext
- Forward secrecy through key rotation
- Protection against offline attacks

#### Storage Strategy Comparison

| Storage Method | Security | Performance | Offline Support | Recommendation |
|----------------|----------|-------------|-----------------|----------------|
| localStorage (plain) | ❌ Very Low | ✅ Excellent | ✅ Full | ❌ Not Recommended |
| sessionStorage (plain) | ❌ Low | ✅ Excellent | ✅ Session | ❌ Not Recommended |
| IndexedDB (plain) | ❌ Low | ✅ Good | ✅ Full | ❌ Not Recommended |
| **localStorage (encrypted)** | ✅ High | ✅ Good | ✅ Full | ✅ **Recommended** |
| sessionStorage (encrypted) | ✅ Medium | ✅ Good | ✅ Session | ⚠️ Short-term only |
| IndexedDB (encrypted) | ✅ High | ✅ Good | ✅ Full | ✅ Alternative |

**Selected Approach: Encrypted localStorage**
- Balance between security, performance, and UX
- Persistent storage for better user experience
- Web Crypto API provides robust encryption
- Clear security boundaries with master password
