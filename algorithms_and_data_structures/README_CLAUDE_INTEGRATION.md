# 🎓 Algorithm Learning CLI with Claude AI Integration

## 🚀 Quick Start Guide

### Using Your Enhanced CLI

You now have **THREE ways** to use your learning system:

### Option 1: Standard CLI (Works Offline)
```bash
python curriculum_cli_enhanced.py
```
- Full curriculum with 50+ lessons
- Progress tracking
- Comprehension checks
- Note-taking

### Option 2: Claude Learning Session (Interactive in Claude Code)
```bash
python claude_learning_session.py
```
Then use commands like:
```python
session.show_progress()
session.load_lesson()
session.display_lesson()
session.ask_claude("Why is this important?")
```

### Option 3: Side-by-Side Learning (RECOMMENDED)
1. **Terminal:** Run `python curriculum_cli_enhanced.py`
2. **Claude Code:** Keep this window open
3. **Learn:** Work through lessons, ask me questions, save insights
