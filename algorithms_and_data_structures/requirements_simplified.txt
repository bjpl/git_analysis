# Simplified CLI Requirements
# Core Python standard library dependencies only

# The simplified CLI uses only Python standard library modules:
# - sys, os (system operations)
# - json (data persistence)  
# - datetime (timestamps)
# - pathlib (file paths)
# - typing (type hints)

# No external dependencies required!
# This makes the CLI:
# - Fast to install
# - No dependency conflicts
# - Works across all Python 3.7+ environments
# - Reliable and stable

# Optional: If you want enhanced colors on Windows
# colorama>=0.4.6

# For development/testing only:
# pytest>=7.0.0
