**Learning Goal**: Decision framework for selecting organizational approaches

#### The Decision Matrix

**Question Framework**:
1. **How will you access the data?**
   - Random access (any item anytime) → Arrays
   - Sequential access (one after another) → Linked Lists
   - Last-used items first → Stacks
   - First-come, first-served → Queues

2. **How is your data related?**
   - Independent items → Arrays or Lists
   - Hierarchical relationships → Trees
   - Complex interconnections → Graphs

3. **How often will you add/remove items?**
   - Rarely changes → Arrays
   - Frequent changes → Linked Lists, Trees, or Graphs
   - Only add/remove from ends → Stacks or Queues

4. **How important is speed vs. flexibility?**
   - Speed priority → Arrays
   - Flexibility priority → Dynamic structures

#### Real-World Decision Examples
**Managing a Music Collection**
- Small collection, rarely changes → Array (alphabetical list)
- Large collection, frequent additions → Tree (searchable by artist/genre)
- Playlist management → Linked List (easy reordering)
