## Duration: 2-3 weeks (15-20 hours total)

## Core Concepts

### 2.1 What is Efficiency? (Week 1, Days 1-2)
**Learning Goal**: Build intuitive understanding of efficiency measurement

#### Real-World Foundation
- **Time Efficiency**: How long does it take?
- **Space Efficiency**: How much room does it need?
- **Energy Efficiency**: How much effort is required?
- **Cost Efficiency**: What resources are consumed?

#### Everyday Examples
- **Grocery Shopping Strategies**:
  - List-based shopping vs. wandering the aisles
  - One big trip vs. multiple small trips
  - Online ordering vs. in-store shopping

#### Key Understanding
- Efficiency depends on what you're measuring
- Different approaches excel in different situations
- Scale matters - what works for small problems might not work for large ones

#### Activities
1. **Efficiency Audit**: Measure time/effort for different approaches to the same task
2. **Scale Experiment**: Compare how different methods perform as problems get bigger
3. **Trade-off Matrix**: Create charts showing pros/cons of various approaches

### 2.2 Time Complexity in Plain Language (Week 1, Days 3-5)
**Learning Goal**: Understand how solution time changes as problems grow

#### The "Big O" Concept (Without the Math)
Think of these as **growth patterns** rather than mathematical formulas:

**Constant Time - "The VIP Pass"**
- *Analogy*: Using an elevator vs. stairs - same time regardless of floor
- *Example*: Looking up a word in a dictionary using page numbers
- *Real-world*: Accessing your email inbox, calling someone by speed dial

**Linear Time - "The Assembly Line"**
- *Analogy*: Reading a book - time doubles when pages double
- *Example*: Counting people in a line, searching through a photo album
- *Real-world*: Proofreading documents, painting a fence

**Quadratic Time - "The Handshake Problem"**
- *Analogy*: Everyone at a party shaking hands with everyone else
- *Example*: Comparing every item with every other item
- *Real-world*: Seating arrangements, tournament brackets

**Logarithmic Time - "The Twenty Questions Game"**
- *Analogy*: Guessing a number by eliminating half the possibilities each time
- *Example*: Finding a name in a phone book by opening to the middle
- *Real-world*: Medical diagnosis through elimination, troubleshooting

#### Visual Learning Tools
- **Growth Charts**: Show how time increases with problem size
- **Story Scenarios**: Characters facing efficiency challenges
- **Interactive Simulations**: Watch algorithms work in real-time

#### Activities
1. **Pattern Recognition**: Identify growth patterns in daily activities
2. **Efficiency Comparison**: Time different approaches to organizing tasks
3. **Scaling Simulation**: Predict how methods will perform with larger datasets

### 2.3 Space Complexity in Plain Language (Week 1, Days 6-7)
**Learning Goal**: Understand how solution storage needs change as problems grow

#### Storage Analogies

**Constant Space - "The Minimalist"**
- *Analogy*: Packing one suitcase regardless of trip length
- *Example*: Using the same workspace no matter how big the project
- *Real-world*: Taking notes on index cards, using a single pot for any recipe

**Linear Space - "The Collector"**
- *Analogy*: Needing one box per item you want to store
- *Example*: Making a backup copy of every file
- *Real-world*: Creating photocopies, maintaining guest lists

**Quadratic Space - "The Comparison Chart"**
- *Analogy*: Creating a comparison grid where every item is compared to every other
- *Example*: A tournament bracket showing all possible matches
- *Real-world*: Distance charts between cities, compatibility matrices

#### Understanding Trade-offs
- **Time vs. Space**: Sometimes using more storage makes things faster
- **Preparation vs. Execution**: Pre-organizing vs. organizing on-the-fly
- **Memory vs. Recalculation**: Storing results vs. computing them again

#### Activities
1. **Storage Audit**: Measure how storage needs change with collection size
2. **Organization Experiment**: Compare space-efficient vs. time-efficient storage
3. **Trade-off Analysis**: Find examples where using more space saves time

### 2.4 Practical Efficiency Thinking (Week 2, Days 1-3)
**Learning Goal**: Apply efficiency concepts to real-world decisions

#### Decision Framework
1. **Identify the Resource**: What are you trying to optimize? (Time, space, money, effort)
2. **Consider the Scale**: How big is the problem? Will it grow?
3. **Evaluate Trade-offs**: What are you willing to sacrifice for efficiency?
4. **Choose Your Approach**: Select the method that best fits your constraints

#### Workplace Applications
- **Email Management**: Different strategies for different volumes
- **File Organization**: Systems that scale with document growth
- **Meeting Scheduling**: Approaches that work for different group sizes
- **Project Planning**: Methods that adapt to project complexity

#### Personal Applications
- **Meal Planning**: Efficiency strategies for different household sizes
- **Travel Planning**: Approaches that scale with trip complexity
- **Social Media Management**: Systems for different levels of activity
- **Learning Organization**: Study methods that grow with knowledge

#### Activities
1. **Efficiency Consulting**: Advise friends on optimizing their routines
2. **Workplace Analysis**: Identify efficiency opportunities in current job
3. **Personal Optimization**: Implement efficiency improvements in daily life

### 2.5 Scalability Thinking (Week 2, Days 4-7)
**Learning Goal**: Understand how solutions perform as problems grow dramatically

#### The Scalability Mindset
- **What works for 10 items might break with 1,000**
- **What works for 1 person might break with 100 people**
- **What works locally might break globally**

#### Scalability Scenarios
**Small Business to Corporation**
- Customer service approaches that scale

#### Identifying Scalability Problems
- **Bottlenecks**: Where does the system slow down?
- **Breaking Points**: At what size does the approach fail?
- **Resource Limits**: What runs out first?
- **Complexity Explosion**: Where does management become impossible?

#### Activities
1. **Scalability Assessment**: Evaluate current systems for growth potential
