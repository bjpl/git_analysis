# Module 1: Foundation - Mental Models and Everyday Analogies

## Learning Objectives
By the end of this module, learners will:
- Understand what algorithms and data structures are in everyday terms
- Recognize algorithmic thinking in daily activities
- Build mental models for computational problem-solving
- Develop comfort with systematic thinking approaches

## Duration: 2-3 weeks (12-18 hours total)

## Core Concepts

### 1.1 What is an Algorithm? (Week 1, Days 1-2)
**Learning Goal**: Demystify algorithms through familiar examples

#### Real-World Analogies
- **Recipe Analogy**: Cooking instructions as step-by-step algorithms
- **Navigation Analogy**: Driving directions as pathfinding algorithms
- **Organization Analogy**: Filing systems as sorting algorithms

#### Key Understanding
- Algorithms are just detailed instructions
- Good algorithms are clear, efficient, and reliable
- We use algorithms constantly without realizing it

#### Activities
1. **Recipe Analysis**: Break down a favorite recipe into algorithmic steps
2. **Daily Algorithm Hunt**: Identify 5 algorithms used in daily routine
3. **Instruction Improvement**: Rewrite unclear instructions more systematically

### 1.2 What are Data Structures? (Week 1, Days 3-4)
**Learning Goal**: Understand data organization through physical metaphors

#### Real-World Analogies
- **Library Analogy**: Books organized by different systems (author, subject, popularity)
- **Office Analogy**: Filing cabinets, desk organizers, bulletin boards
- **Kitchen Analogy**: Spice racks, refrigerator organization, pantry systems

#### Key Understanding
- Data structures are ways to organize information
- Different organizations serve different purposes
- The right organization makes finding things easier

#### Activities
1. **Organization Audit**: Analyze how personal spaces are organized
2. **Efficiency Comparison**: Compare finding items in organized vs. disorganized spaces
3. **Design Challenge**: Create an organization system for a specific collection

### 1.3 Computational Thinking Fundamentals (Week 1, Days 5-7)
**Learning Goal**: Develop systematic problem-solving mindset

#### The Four Pillars (with analogies)
1. **Decomposition** - Breaking complex problems into smaller pieces
   - *Analogy*: Planning a party by breaking it into guest list, food, venue, entertainment
   
2. **Pattern Recognition** - Finding similarities and trends
   - *Analogy*: Recognizing traffic patterns to choose the best commute time
   
3. **Abstraction** - Focusing on important details while ignoring irrelevant ones
   - *Analogy*: Using a subway map that shows connections but not street details
   
4. **Algorithm Design** - Creating step-by-step solutions
   - *Analogy*: Creating a morning routine that gets you to work on time

#### Activities
1. **Problem Decomposition Exercise**: Break down "planning a vacation" into sub-problems
2. **Pattern Hunting**: Find patterns in personal data (expenses, habits, preferences)
3. **Abstraction Practice**: Create simplified models of complex systems
4. **Algorithm Creation**: Design algorithms for common tasks

### 1.4 Efficiency and Trade-offs (Week 2, Days 1-3)
**Learning Goal**: Understand that different approaches have different costs

#### Real-World Analogies
- **Transportation Analogy**: Walking vs. driving vs. flying (time vs. cost vs. convenience)
- **Shopping Analogy**: Buying in bulk vs. shopping frequently (storage vs. convenience)
- **Communication Analogy**: Email vs. phone vs. in-person (speed vs. richness vs. effort)

#### Key Understanding
- Every solution has trade-offs
- "Best" depends on what you're optimizing for
- Resources include time, space, money, effort, and complexity

#### Activities
1. **Trade-off Analysis**: Compare different approaches to common tasks
2. **Optimization Challenge**: Find the "best" route under different constraints
3. **Resource Management Game**: Simulate resource allocation decisions

### 1.5 Problem-Solving Mindset (Week 2, Days 4-7)
**Learning Goal**: Develop confidence in tackling unfamiliar problems

#### Mental Models
- **The Scientific Method**: Hypothesis, test, refine
- **The Design Process**: Understand, ideate, prototype, test
- **The Debug Mindset**: When things don't work, investigate systematically

#### Building Confidence
- Start with what you know
- Break problems into smaller pieces
- It's okay to not know the answer immediately
- Learning from "failures" is progress

#### Activities
1. **Mystery Solving**: Use systematic approaches to solve logic puzzles
2. **Process Documentation**: Document personal problem-solving approaches
3. **Peer Teaching**: Explain a complex concept to someone else
4. **Reflection Journal**: Track learning journey and breakthrough moments

## Assessment Methods
