# Algorithms and Data Structures Curriculum for Non-STEM Professionals

## Overview

This curriculum transforms abstract computer science concepts into accessible learning experiences using everyday analogies, progressive skill building, and practical applications. Designed specifically for professionals from business, arts, social sciences, and other non-technical backgrounds.

## Learning Philosophy

### Core Principles
- **Analogy-First Learning**: Every concept starts with familiar real-world examples
- **Progressive Complexity**: Each module builds naturally on previous knowledge
- **Multiple Pathways**: Different routes accommodate various learning styles
- **Practical Application**: Immediate relevance through real-world projects
- **Pattern Recognition**: Understanding concepts before memorizing implementations

### Target Audience
- Business professionals seeking analytical skills
- Creative professionals exploring computational thinking
- Career changers entering tech fields
- Educators teaching computational concepts
- Anyone curious about how computers solve problems

## Curriculum Structure

The curriculum consists of 7 interconnected modules, each designed to be completed in 2-3 weeks with flexible pacing options.

## Learning Pathways

### Visual Learner Path
