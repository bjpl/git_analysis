# Quick Start Guide - Algorithms & Data Structures CLI

## 🚀 Fastest Way to Start Learning

### Option 1: Windows Users (Simplest)
Just double-click the `learn.bat` file in your project folder!

### Option 2: Command Line (Any OS)
```bash
python scripts/run_offline.py
```

### Option 3: Standard Launch
```bash
python cli.py --offline
```

## 📚 What You Can Do

Once the CLI starts, you'll see a menu with these options:

1. **Browse Curriculum** - See all available lessons organized by topic
2. **Continue Learning** - Pick up where you left off
3. **Manage Notes** - Take and review notes for each lesson
4. **View Progress** - Track your learning journey
5. **Practice Problems** - Test your knowledge with exercises
6. **Claude AI Guide** - Tips for using Claude as a learning companion
7. **Settings** - Customize your experience
8. **Advanced Mode** - Access additional features
9. **Interactive Mode** - Engage in hands-on learning

## 🎯 First Time User?

1. Start with option **1** to browse the curriculum
2. Choose **Foundations** module
3. Begin with **Big O Notation** lesson
4. Take notes as you learn (option 3)
5. Test yourself with practice problems (option 5)

## 💡 Learning Path

The curriculum is organized progressively:

**Foundations** → **Data Structures** → **Algorithms** → **Advanced Topics**

Each lesson includes:
- Clear explanations with real-world analogies
- Interactive examples
- Practice problems
- Progress tracking

## 🔧 Troubleshooting

If you see any errors:

1. Make sure Python 3.7+ is installed:
   ```bash
   python --version
   ```

2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. If still having issues, run in debug mode:
   ```bash
   python cli.py --offline --debug
   ```
