- Clear completion signals provide satisfaction

**Technical Implementation:**
```javascript
// Multi-pattern approach
if (knownTotal) {
    showProgressBar(current, total);
} else if (countableSteps) {
    showXofY(currentStep, totalSteps);
} else {
    showSpinner(currentOperation);
}
```

### 7.3 Confirmation and Error Patterns

**Confirmation Patterns:**
- **Destructive Actions**: Always confirm before irreversible operations
- **Batch Operations**: Summarize changes before execution
- **Smart Defaults**: Pre-select likely choices while allowing override
