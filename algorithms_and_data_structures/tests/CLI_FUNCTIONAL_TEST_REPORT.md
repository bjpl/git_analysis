3. **Remove Placeholders**: Either implement or remove "coming soon" features
4. **Improve Error Handling**: Add comprehensive error handling for interactive mode

### Short-term Improvements (Major)
1. **Practice Problems**: Implement actual coding challenges and exercises
2. **Enhanced Claude Integration**: Consider API integration for automated assistance
3. **Input Validation**: Add robust input validation throughout the application
4. **Feature Completion**: Complete implementation of all promised features

### Long-term Enhancements
1. **Content Development**: Expand educational content and learning modules
2. **User Experience**: Improve overall UX based on usability findings
3. **Testing Framework**: Implement comprehensive automated testing

## Conclusion

The CLI shows good architectural foundation with working progress tracking, notes management, and file I/O operations. However, it suffers from significant gaps between promised and delivered functionality. The most critical issues are the missing core educational content (algorithms and data structures) and poor error handling in interactive mode.

While the technical infrastructure is solid, the application needs substantial development to meet user expectations for a complete algorithms and data structures learning platform.

**Overall Assessment: NEEDS MAJOR DEVELOPMENT**
- ✅ Infrastructure: Good
- ❌ Core Features: Missing
- ⚠️ Usability: Partial
- ⚠️ Reliability: Needs improvement

**Estimated Development Effort**: 4-6 weeks to address critical issues and implement missing core features.
